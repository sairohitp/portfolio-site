# Portfolio Site w/ React JS

## Welcome & Greetings

Hello! for those of you wondering, this is a portfolio website, created as a project, of myself.
The project has been developed in such a way that it contains all the different components a certain portfolio site would employ.
Everything in the site is pretty functional except a few quirks here and there. & finally, due to time crunch and other reasons, I wasn't able to make it completely responsive, although a few components are. (and to the critics out there, yes I do know how it can be made responsive, given more time, as earlier stated. simple media screen queries :)

## Note

The application has been developed on a 14 inch – chrome browser. it's best if the client also views it in the same. to make it completly flexible across all screen sizes and browsers wasn't attended to due to time crunch and other reasons, as being said for the 100th time.

All links and icons are functional, including the ones in the contact form, except the falling under the "project" component. although they work, they just dont' yet point to anything. which can be tweaked easily.

## Disclaimer

For the adult humor hidden away in the site, no offence intended. just plain classic office.

The links and images used in the site to showcase under sections "projects" etc. are not owned by me, and are merely just placeholders intended to only show their functionality's existence. Although, they can be updated as well.

## Concepts Embedded

During the design and make of this project, I have gone through the implementation of several technologies and utilized concepts core to them, such as:

HTML 5
CSS 3

Font-awesome icon pack CDN

ReactJS
JSX w/ export function
Props
States

Array maps
SliderJS
EmailJS

Extensive use of CSS flex
Comprehensive implantation of CSS grid
Globally enabled CSS variables for the perfect site consistency
Multi-display responsive support using @mediaqueries

## Conclusion

The project began with a few files and the library just grew out of control. There's just a certain beauty in seeing your project grow and get more and more files into it. and not just random, blankspace placeholder kinds of files, rather useful ones – components and actual code. I guess only true developers can relate to this, cause its their child & they're seeing it go through different stages of it's life.

Sad tears occupy my eyes in growing happiness for this project has now started it's maiden host. & in the coming years, I'll beautify you, functional-ise you more than before and memeorise you completely, till death. I hope you liked surfing. even if you didn't, I know you did. 'cause there just doen't exist any art that's ever below par. In one's eyes it lies how s/he views it all, and it's the greatest there ever was and will ever be.
